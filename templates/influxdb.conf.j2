### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# The values in this file override the default values used by the system if
# a config option is not specified. The commented out lines are the configuration
# field and the default value used. Uncommenting a line and changing the value
# will change the value used at runtime when the process is restarted.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report usage data to usage.influxdata.com

# usage data. No data from user databases is ever transmitted.
